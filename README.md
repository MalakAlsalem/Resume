Resume Project
==============

This is a project for Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from [Udacity][1].

**What I have done:**
Using jQuery, developed an interactive resume application that reads all data from a JSON file and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information. 
Further customized the project by personalizing the design using CSS.

**To run the application:**
Download the repository, extract it and open index.html in your browser to see the working tests.
